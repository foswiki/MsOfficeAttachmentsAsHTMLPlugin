Note: a version of this extension is available for use with TWiki. Please contact Foswiki:Main.CrawfordCurrie for details on how to retrieve it.

---++ Usage

Attach a .doc file to a topic, and it will automatically generate a .html version of the attachment. If the topic text contains the magic setting:
<pre>
   * Set<nop> REPLACE_WITH_ATTACHMENT = on
</pre>
then the topic content will automatically be replaced by an include of the (HTML) content of the attachment, using the following template:
   * Set REPLACEMENTNOTE = This text was automatically generated from the attachment <nop>$attachment<br>%INCLUDE{%ATTACHURL%/$convertedAttachmentPath}%

---++ Installation Instructions

This package requires a convertor that can convert from Word documents to HTML. Candidates are [[http://wvware.sourceforge.net/][wvHtml]] and [[http://www.abisource.com/][AbiWord]]

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

Run =configure= and if necessary adjust the pathname to the convertor program.

There is one other important setting accessible through =configure=; =$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{MsOfficeAttachmentsAsHTMLPlugin}{filters}=. This is an array of (perl) regular expression substitutions that the generated HTML document is processed through. This allows you to rewrite sections of the HTML to remove Microsoft Word features. By default there is a single expression, which rewrites image links in the HTML to refer to the topic attachment directory.

Note that any Foswiki macros in the rewriting rules are expanded *before* the rule is applied. Be careful that the expansion of any such macros doesn't add new regular-expression meta-characters.
